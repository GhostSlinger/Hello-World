# Hello-World


Hi Guys,

I am Wilbert, I love Virtual Reality since I first heard about it.
Thinking about it, there are endless opportunities in Virtual Reality.

A human going to an era of new technology. Imagine if virtual reality enable you to bring your conscious to the digital world.

Imagine if people suffering from blindness or deaf. Those people wouldn't be able to see the world or learn our language.
Now think if its possible to bring them to rehabilitate in the virtual world, they would be able to see images made in the digital world and would be able to hear and use all full senses that they thought they never had before.

With this people with disabilities could learn through the digital world and could make people who are deaf to be able to speak.

This is an optimistic opinion, but I hope one day our technology breakthrough would reach that point.
I myself deeply wish it would come true.
